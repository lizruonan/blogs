Hey, I'm Elizabeth. I am a mathematics enthusiast, an anime lover (it is art!), and a self-teaching digital drawing artist. In my past 6 years, I've been immersing myself in the wonderful world of math. Why did I choose math, you may wonder? Well, after shopping around in various fields of subjects in my first year of undergrad, I began to feel that math could guide me infinitely close to the ground truth of this world. Cheesy as it might sound, but it was my genuine feelings and was my initial intention of pursuing math. The journey, therefore, began in the summer of 2014. 

Now it has been 6 years, and I've finished my M.S. studies in mathematics at NYU Courant. I became a little smarter, a little wiser, and a little balder, too. Although my academic journey in mathematics has coming to an end, my trip in this real world is just beginning. As many people say, learning and studying is a life-long process. Whenever there's an interesting topic, I would look into it and write something about it in my blog. For I hope that many years later, I could trace back what I've gained throughout the time.
