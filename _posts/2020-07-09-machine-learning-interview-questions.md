**Most Common Questions in Machine Learning**

1. *What is the trade-off between bias and variance?* 

2. *What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?*

   Def of supervised learning: 

   given a training set, we want to learn a function $$h: X -> Y$$ so that $$h(x)$$ is a "good" predictor for the corresponding value of $$y$$. 

3. *How is KNN different from k-means clustering?*

4. *Explain how a ROC curve works.*

5. *Define precision and recall.*

6. *What is Bayes’ Theorem? How is it useful in a machine learning context?*

   

7. *Why is “Naive” Bayes naive?*

8. *Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.*

9. *What’s your favorite algorithm, and can you explain it to me in less than a minute?*

10. *What’s the difference between Type I and Type II error?*

11. What’s a Fourier transform?

12. What’s the difference between probability and likelihood?

13. What is deep learning, and how does it contrast with other machine learning algorithms?
